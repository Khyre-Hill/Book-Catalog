# Book-Catalog

Source code developed in three different files: Book.java, BookDemo.java, and BookNotFoundException.java.

1. Read the library catalog from an input data file.  The data file should be named catalog.txt. There is one input line per book, and these lines have the following format:<book_id> <book_title> <ISBN> <author_last_name> <category> where <book_id> is a 5-digit positive integer, <book_title> is a string of at most 30 characters with no embedded blanks(you can use “_” in between words in a title), <ISBN>  is a string of 10 digits, <author_last_name> is a string of at most 10 characters, and <category> is a character (‘F’ if the book is fiction; ‘N’ if it is a non-fiction book).
  
  The output should include the book_id, book_title, ISBN, author_last_name, and “Fiction” or “Non-Fiction” for category,printed on a single line.
